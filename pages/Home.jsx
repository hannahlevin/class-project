                            Since the Trump Administration repealed the DACA program in September 2017, we have been concerned for our friends and classmates whose safety, academic opportunities, and DREAMs for a bright future in the country they grew up in have been compromised.  
                            We are a group of Carlmont High School and Design Tech High School students who have tasked ourselves with building a safety net and speaking up for those who are now too afraid to speak for themselves. Come join our ranks, and together we can make a difference.
